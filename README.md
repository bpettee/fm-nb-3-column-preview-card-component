## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS + BEM
- Flexbox
- Responsive Design

### What I learned

HTML

- Used semantic tags **main** and **section** for 3 cards

CSS

- targeted HTML elements for styling using content-independent ID's and Class names derived from repeating structural and functional patterns present in the design
- used **BEM** naming convention for **card** block and elements
- used single-row/column **Flexbox** for responsive desktop and mobile layout

Accessibility

- set line height to 1.5 as it is considered the minimum height for accessibility.

### Continued development

HTML

- I want to continue to develope my understanding of the proper use of **semantic HTML** in structuring document content and providing increased accessibility.

CSS

- Continue to explore the usefulness and limitations of BEM naming convention.
- Explore the use of **utility-first** CSS; specifically Tailwind.
